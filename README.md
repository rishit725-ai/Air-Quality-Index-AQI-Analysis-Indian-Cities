# Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis – Indian Cities

### IBM Green Horizon Case Study

---

## About This Project

This project focuses on analyzing **Air Quality Index (AQI)** data for major Indian cities using publicly available datasets from the **CPCB-based India Air Quality Dataset repository**.

The goal is to understand pollution trends, study the impact of different pollutants, and explore how data analytics and machine learning techniques can help in environmental monitoring. The project is inspired by the **IBM Green Horizon initiative**, which works on smart air quality monitoring and pollution prediction systems.

## Dataset Used

**Source:**
[https://github.com/cp099/India-Air-Quality-Dataset](https://github.com/cp099/India-Air-Quality-Dataset)

The dataset contains AQI values along with estimated pollutant concentrations such as:

* PM2.5
* PM10
* NO₂
* SO₂
* CO
* O₃

These pollutant values are calculated using standard AQI conversion formulas and mathematical estimation methods. The dataset is suitable for analysis, visualization, and basic prediction experiments.

## What This Project Does

In this notebook, the following tasks are performed:

* Cleaning and preprocessing the AQI dataset
* Exploring pollution trends across cities
* Visualizing AQI and pollutant distributions
* Studying correlations between AQI and pollutants
* Comparing air quality levels among major cities
* Preparing the data for further machine learning experiments

## Why IBM Green Horizon?

IBM Green Horizon is a real-world platform that uses AI and data analytics to monitor air pollution and predict environmental risks.

This project is a small-scale academic implementation inspired by that idea, showing how similar analysis pipelines can be built using open-source tools and publicly available data.
